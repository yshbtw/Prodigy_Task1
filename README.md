# Task 01: Data Visualization with Bar Chart / Histogram
This project focuses on visualizing demographic data using a bar chart or histogram to understand the distribution of population data across different countries. Visualization techniques like these help reveal patterns and trends within large datasets, making data easier to interpret and analyze.

# Dataset
Source: World Bank Population Data Description: The dataset provides population data for various countries across multiple years. It includes information such as total population, country names, and demographic data that is useful for trend analysis and comparison.

# Approach
Data Loading: The World Bank dataset is imported for analysis, containing population data across countries.

Data Cleaning: The data is checked for any missing values or inconsistencies. We focus on filtering relevant data points, such as selecting a specific year or demographic information.

Data Preprocessing: Relevant columns are selected, and data is aggregated if necessary to make it suitable for visualization.

Data Visualization: A bar chart is used to display the distribution of population across different countries or demographic groups.

# Topics Covered
Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is accurate and reliable by handling missing values and filtering irrelevant data.

Data Visualization: Applying bar charts and histograms to display data distributions, facilitating easy analysis of trends and patterns.

Data Aggregation: Summarizing data by relevant categories for clearer visual comparisons.

Insights Extraction: Interpreting visual data to derive insights, making complex data more understandable. Usage

Download the World Bank population dataset from the provided link. Place the dataset file in the project directory. Run the data visualization script to generate a bar chart or histogram of population distribution. Results The bar chart or histogram created from this task provides a visual summary of the population distribution by country or demographic category. Through this visualization, key insights emerge, such as which countries have the largest populations and how populations are distributed across categories. This analysis can serve as a foundation for further demographic studies.
